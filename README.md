🎯 Double Word – Educational Digital Dobble

An educational “doubles” game that supports early reading skills by pairing words with visual images.
Designed to help learners — including dyslexic readers — recognize patterns, strengthen decoding, and build rapid word–image association.

📋 Overview

Double Word adapts the classic Dobble/Spot It! mechanic to literacy practice: each card shows 8 items, and exactly one word–image pair is common to any two cards. Behind the scenes, cards are shuffled with a uniform Fisher–Yates algorithm; the UI uses event-driven updates and dynamic DOM rendering for a smooth experience.

🎮 How to Play

Two cards appear, each with 8 items (mix of words and images).

Find the single matching word–image pair across both cards.

Correct match: +5 · Wrong guess: –1.

New round starts automatically every 90s.
